# Module 0: Crypto

In this module, you'll learn about the C programming language. It's a great language that has been used to make small and large programs alike. You'll start with the small ones!


## Help

For information on (or help with) this module:

1. Attend your mentor's section meeting.

1. Use `help50`, `eprintf` and `debug50` as needed.

1. Ask questions during office hours using the "Ask" tool on this website.

1. Visit (or e-mail) the course's heads.

## Getting Started

Your first program will be a classic. The goal of this exercise is to try out compiling your program, maybe fixing a typo and getting used to the editor. No need to submit!

- Watch the lecture on [C](/lectures/c)

- Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/join){:.external}

- Write your first program: [Hello](https://lab.cs50.io/uva/cs50x/master/problems/hello/){:.external}

Next up, you'll create an instance of the CS50 IDE, which will be your "code editor" for the coming weeks. The goal is to write a very small program from scratch and learning to test your program using `check50`. (Note that the IDE currently only works in Chrome and Firefox!)

- Login to the [CS50 IDE](https://ide.cs50.io/){:.external} using your GitHub account

- Learn about using the [Command Line](/shorts/command-line) in the IDE

- Create a "`module0`" directory in the IDE as by `mkdir ~/module0` and `cd` into it

- Implement [Water](/problems/water)


## Grading

As soon as you have submitted working solutions for all problems below, your mentor will assess your programs, assign a grade for "quality", and provide you with some written feedback. This week, your programs will be primarily graded on:

- Use of comments
- Naming of variables
- Use of indentation
- Use of whitespace


## What to Do

- Watch the lecture on [Tools](/lectures/tools)

- Watch the lecture on [Arrays](/lectures/arrays)

- Implement either of:

    - [Initials](/problems/initials-less), for most students

    - [Initials](/problems/initials-more), "hacker" edition

- Implement:

    - [Caesar](/problems/caesar)

- Implement either of:

    - [Vigenere](/problems/vigenere), for most students

    - [Crack](/problems/crack), hacker edition
