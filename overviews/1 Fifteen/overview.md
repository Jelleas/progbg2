# Module 1: Fifteen

In this module, you'll learn about arrays and about algorithms that you might implement in C. Searching and sorting algorithms will be part of many programs that you write!


## Help

For information on (or help with) this module:

1. Attend your mentor's section meeting.

1. Use `help50`, `eprintf` and `debug50` as needed.

1. Ask questions during office hours using the "Ask" tool on this website.

1. Visit (or e-mail) the course's heads.

## Grading

As soon as you have submitted working solutions for all problems below, your mentor will assess your programs, assign a grade for "quality", and provide you with some written feedback. This week, your programs will be primarily graded on:

- [Magic numbers](/quality/magic-numbers)
- [Loops](/quality/loops)
- [Duplication](/quality/duplication)
- [Nesting](/quality/nesting)

And we'll also take these into account from last week: [comments](/quality/comments), [naming](/quality/naming), [indentation](/quality/indentation), [whitespace](/quality/whitespace).


## What to Do

- Watch the lecture on [Tools](/lectures/tools)

- Watch the lecture on [Algorithms](/lectures/algorithms)

- Implement either of:

    - [Find](/problems/find-less), the version for most students

    - [Find](/problems/find-more), the "hacker" edition

- Then, implement [Fifteen](/problems/fifteen)
